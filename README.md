### HR Dashboard P3

**Description:** The dataset was a combination of two CSV files. 
First CSV file, EmployeeSampleDataCSV.CSV consisted of Employee information such as their full name, ethnicity, hire date, department they work under, salary and if they were eligible for bonus. It has 1000 records with various data type such as text/varchar, currency, numbers, and date.     
The second CSV file, DepartmentSampleDataCSV.CSV consisted of the department information such as code, name, address. This CSV file contained 7 records with various data types such as text/varchar and numbers.     
The main focus for this project was method of data import.
The two CSV files were uploaded as flat files to SQL Database. Cleaned and transformed. Once imported, the tables were created within a designated database and table altered to include foreign key to establish relationship between the two tables.  
A SQL query was then created to join the two tables. A new measure was also added to the joined table. 
The SQL query was then used to upload the table into PowerBI via the SQL Direct Query option.
The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling/ reviewing for missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing demographics, and creating statistical measures such as Average and Sum of Annual Salary of Employees.
